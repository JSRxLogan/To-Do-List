This was my very first attempt at building a to-do list, developed in pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I created this project as part of a challenge from my college club head while I was midway through learning JavaScript.

## 🪄 Background Story
About 4 months ago, while in the middle of learning JavaScript, I was given a task by my college’s club head to build a to-do app. I didn’t want to make just any regular to-do app, so I came up with a unique idea: divide tasks into four categories—**Daily, Weekly, Monthly, Yearly**.

I successfully created the layout with HTML and CSS, but ran into challenges while implementing the logic in JavaScript. My original idea was to create a copy of an existing to-do task and append user input dynamically (a bit of a jugad method). I struggled a lot with this part and eventually decided to put the category implementation on hold.

Instead of forcing it, I took a step back, focused on learning the right skills, and promised myself I’d return to complete the vision properly.
